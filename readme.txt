A small gallery plugin using the built in media uploader and gallery shortcodes.

== Description ==

The Mojo Gallery is a very simple Wordpress gallery plugin that aims to help people add a small simple gallery to their site/blog. It makes use of mostly built in functions and shortcodes so is fairly lightweight, with additional features as optional extras.

This is very much a DEVELOPMENT release and should only be used for testing or as a starting point for your own project.

Also I'm sorry I'm new to SVN I normally use git so excuse me if there are loads of stupid commits!

== Installation ==

Installation is simple, just like every other Wordpress plugin. 

Either:

1. Download and unzip the plugin to your local machine.
2. Upload `mojo-gallery` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Or:

1. Goto Add New Plugin in your Wordpress Dashboard.
2. Search for 'Mojo Gallery'
3. Click 'Install Now' and follow the instructions.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed everything and I see the Mojo Gallery Panel, but I don't see anything on my site? =

The backend/admin area side of this plugin works great, however front end templates have not yet been developed. As such you will either have to develop your own templates for `archive-mojo_gallery_album.php` and `single-mojo_gallery_album.php` or wait for a more stable future release. Sorry.

= How do I get involved in the development? =

Check out the Developer Notes section for more info.
